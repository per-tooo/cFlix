# cFlix

cFlix is a project that aims to create a new and usable frontend for YouTube, that looks like YouTube. This is also directly inspired by [Invidious](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious), which is a simmilar project but already completet.
My personal aim for this one is to use as little libraries as possible.
